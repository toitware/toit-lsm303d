## Note

This driver does not work with other LSM303 sensors.

Documentation for the LSM303D: https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm303d.html#documentation
The Datasheet is TN0018.

The heading functionality was inspired by https://github.com/pololu/lsm303-arduino
It could maybe be improved by using DT0058 (on the ST site), or by using [AN3192]
